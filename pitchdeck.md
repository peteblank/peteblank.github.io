# description 

Multiplayer dog is a game inspired by superm ario bros and supersmash. 

Whoever wins the most coins, gets to keep all the tokens at the end of the game.

# technical information

I used phaser 3(phaser.js) to make the game, colyseus for the multiplayer, openzepellin for interacting with the contract.

I will make an escrow contract for keeping the players coins during the game.

I might add in an nfts contract for the shop if there is time.

# Roadmap

Adding more items to the game, making so the players can hit each other and drop each others coins, maybe a shop for nfts and much more...

# Team information

Its just me
